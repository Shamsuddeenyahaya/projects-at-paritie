## Overview

This was an intresting challenge which gave me an oppurtinity for using the flex and grid properly and making the layout of the website in a pretty clam and best ways.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Implementation of CSS grid and flexbox to replicate the design given.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned about CSS Grid and Flexbox shrink grow, before and after pseudo elements.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.testimonial-section::before {
  content: "";
  background: url(images/bg-quotes.png) no-repeat;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 15%;
  right: 1%;
  z-index: -1;
}
```


### Continued development

JS can be added for form elements plus CSS hover for footer elements.
